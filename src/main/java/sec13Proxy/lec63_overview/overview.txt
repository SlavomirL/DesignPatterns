- proxy gives you the same interface but entirely different behaviour

- proxy is a class that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality

-summary:
    -  a proxy has the same interface as underlying object
    - to create a proxy, simply replicate the existing interface of an object
    - add relevant functionality to the redefined member functions
    - different proxies (communication, logging, caching,...) have completely different behaviors
